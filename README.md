# Movie Genre ELT pipeline

## Project Overview
This project is a hands-on exploration of ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline practices and the implementation of a data processing architecture known as the Medallion Architecture(Multi-hop Architectures). The primary goal is to showcase the utilization of Azure services, specifically Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS2), and Azure Active Directory, to build an efficient and idempotent data pipeline for movie genre data. In addition, exploring a new feature in Databricks, Autoloader for ingesting data.


## Key Objectives
* ELT Pipeline Practice: Gain practical experience in designing and implementing ELT processes, focusing on the extraction, loading, and transformation of movie genre data in Cloud Service.
* Azure Services Exploration: Explore and leverage key Azure services, including Azure Databricks for scalable data processing, ADLS2 for secure data storage, and Azure Active Directory for authentication and access control.
* Medallion Architecture Implementation: Implement the Medallion Architecture, a data processing model that separates raw, transformed, and curated data layers using Bronze, Silver, and Gold tables with Delta Lake.
* Data Ingestion: 
    1. Databricks Autoloader
Discover the cutting-edge features of Databricks Autoloader, a modern solution for efficiently ingesting batch data. Experience the streamlined and automated approach it brings to the data ingestion process.
    2. Traditional Batch Data Ingestion
Compare and contrast the modern approach with the traditional method of ingesting batch data. Gain insights into the nuances of both techniques, understanding the trade-offs and benefits for your specific use case.
